Hey everyone,

We're excited to share some great news with you all! GameVault has reached a small milestone with over 600 official installations of our GameVault Client Application. <!-- truncate --> What's even more amazing is that around 200 dedicated users, a third of these installations, have joined our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) community to connect, chat, and share their experiences.

We want to express our immense gratitude for your incredible support, feedback, and love for GameVault. Your ongoing encouragement inspires us to push boundaries and enhance your gaming experience. We're thrilled to announce that an awesome update is being worked on right now - the highly anticipated release of GameVault's Installation Pipeline!

#### GameVault's Installation Pipeline

The Installation Pipeline is designed to revolutionize how you install and manage your games. It was suggested by members on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu). We understand the challenges of navigating through different installation processes, especially for family members who may not be tech-savvy. With the Installation Pipeline, our goal is to simplify the entire process and make it user-friendly. Whether you're an experienced gamer or not, this update will make installing games easier for you.

You can read the details [here on the GitHub issue](https://github.com/Phalcode/gamevault-app/issues/18).

Stay tuned for its upcoming release, and to be among the first to try out this awesome feature, make sure to subscribe to the `@Updates` Role on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) , if you haven't already. We'll ping you as soon as it's live!

#### Join us on Lemmy

To further connect with our amazing community, we're excited to announce the launch of our [official Lemmy community](https://lemmy.world/c/phalcode).
