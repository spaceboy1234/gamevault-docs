Hey folks,

Great news. We've successfully migrated our App name in its entirety and will resume advertising as soon as it's published on the Microsoft Store. <!-- truncate -->

Just a heads up, there might be a surge of new users joining the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu) server due to us promoting GameVault across all available platforms now.

You're welcome to join in and spread the word about GameVault with your friends, family, social network, or colleagues!

**Let's decipher the mystery behind the new logo:**
![logo](/img/blog/2023-07-19/logo-text-and-image-sbs.png)

- The Box represents a Vault with a Keyhole, but it also symbolizes a game dice.
- The Keyhole represents a Keyhole, and simultaneously signifies a game piece.

Did you find the logo concept creative? Share your thoughts on [discord](https://discord.gg/NEdNen2dSu)!
