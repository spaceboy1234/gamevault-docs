# Introduction

## What is GameVault?

GameVault is an innovative gaming platform providing a self-hosted, [source-available](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) alternative to popular gaming platforms. It lets you and your friends enjoy DRM-free games stored **on your file server** in an organized way.

Think of it as your personal Steam or Plex server, but for your personal video game collection (and without streaming). It lets you and your friends enjoy your games from anywhere.

You put your game files (installers, binaries, etc.) from wherever you have them into a folder and the platform detects them, enriches them with metadata and offers a user-friendly interface to easily organize, download, install, and play your games. It even tracks your playtimes and progress.

GameVault consists of two components:

- A self-hosted backend server served with Docker
- A client application to use this server
