# Server News

You now have the ability to share news and updates with your users by providing a `news.md` file. Use this file to link them to your game wishlist form, share important updates, or just say hello.

This file supports [Markdown](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax, making it easy to format and structure your content. You can edit the `news.md` file using any text editor or script. It is located at `/config/news.md`.

Once updated, users will receive a notification icon in their client, ensuring they see the latest news.
